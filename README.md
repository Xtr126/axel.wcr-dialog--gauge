# axel.wcr-dialog--gauge
Process axel wget rsync curl output and send to dialog, including time left, speed and all output from the commands. 
Code for this already exist on the internet, but they only show progress, no time left, speed etc. So i decided to make my own, and you won't find any code for axel on the internet, only wget.
rsync and curl are planned
